# The optional iisnode.yml file provides overrides of the iisnode configuration settings specified in web.config.

# node_env - determines the environment (production, development, staging, ...) in which
# child node processes run; if nonempty, is propagated to the child node processes as their NODE_ENV
# environment variable; the default is the value of the IIS worker process'es NODE_ENV
# environment variable

node_env:

# watchedFiles - semi-colon separated list of files that will be watched for changes; a change to a file causes the application to recycle;
# each entry consists of an optional directory name plus required file name which are relative to the directory where the main application entry point
# is located; wild cards are allowed in the file name portion only; for example: "*.js;node_modules\foo\lib\options.json;app_data\*.config.json"

# loggingEnabled - controls whether stdout and stderr streams from node processes are captured and made available over HTTP

# logDirectory - directory name relative to the main application file that will store files with stdout and stderr captures; 
# individual log file names have unique file names; log files are created lazily (i.e. when the process actually writes something
# to stdout or stderr); an HTML index of all log files is also maintained as index.html in that directory;
# by default, if your application is at http://foo.com/bar.js, logs will be accessible at http://foo.com/iisnode;
# SECURITY NOTE: if log files contain sensitive information, this setting should be modified to contain enough entropy to be considered
# cryptographically secure; in most situations, a GUID is sufficient
